# Image_Encryption

The goal of this project is to develop a Java application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt images using the XOR encryption algorithm and a user-specified key. The application have a graphical user interface (GUI) implemented using the Java Swing library and the JFrame class.

The application have the following features:

A "Select Image" button that allows the user to choose an image file from their local file system. The supported image file formats should include .jpg, .png, and .bmp.

A "Key" text field that allows the user to enter a key for the XOR encryption. 

After Selecting the image the Encryption process starts and when it's done its Pops out a message DONE!.

The decryption process is same as of encryption enter the same key used while while encrypting the image and select the image to start decrpting.

A "Save" button that allows the user to save the encrypted or decrypted image to their local file system.

The application also have error handling to handle cases where the user tries to encrypt or decrypt an image without first selecting an image or entering a key.

Overall, the completed project should be a functional, user-friendly application that allows users to easily encrypt and decrypt images using the XOR encryption algorithm.
